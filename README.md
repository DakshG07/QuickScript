# QuickScript
QuickScript is an open source programming language written in Python. It is built on the foundation to allow you to code in a more English-friendly way. It's a small fun project I have started. It has a unique way of handling things, and I'm including new features such as custom Types and feature implenation. As of now, to use it,  you need to edit test.qs, or create a .qs file and then change the *code_file* variable so it looks like this:

*from modules import \**  
*code_file = "test.qs"*  
*with open(code_file) as f:*  
    *#get code*  
    *code_raw = f.read()*  
And yeah! We don't have a documentation yet, you'll need to look at the program...actually, I'll just make one right now.
