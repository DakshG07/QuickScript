QuickScript is an open source programming language written in Python. It is built on the foundation to allow you to "code" in English. It greatly simplifies keywords and expressions, and creates a more human-readable syntax. It is currently under development, we would like help! This language is aimed at beginners who are starting to code. It tries to keep things relativly simple. It is definetly a more high-level programming language.
